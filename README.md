## FreeCodeCamp React Project - Markdown Previewer

## User Story
- [ ] I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
- [ ] I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

## Thoughts
This time I went for a simple project, especially since the main part was already implemented - I mean interpreting markdown. Aside from this there was actually not much to do - very simple.
